## 📌 Problem Statement

Public places often face issues such as:

* Spitting (gutkha/pan)
* Throwing garbage
* Vandalism
* Littering
* Loud noise & public nuisance

These behaviors:

* Damage public property
* Increase maintenance costs
* Harm public health
* Reduce civic discipline

Indian Railways alone spends approximately **₹12,000 crore per year** cleaning spit and waste.

## 💡 Our Solution

SAHARA is an **AI + IoT based smart civic accountability system** that detects and immediately responds to uncivil behavior in public spaces.

### 🔍 ML-Based Detection

* Cameras monitor public areas.
* Machine Learning models detect:

  * Spitting
  * Littering
  * Vandalism
  * Public nuisance

### 📦 Action Box

* Once detected, notification is sent to the control room.
* Automated response system is triggered.

### 🌐 Web Interface

* Live video monitoring
* Instant alert controls
* Action buttons for response

### 🚨 Response Mechanisms

* Voice warning
* Buzzer alert
* Glitter spray
* Mist spray deterrent

Unlike traditional CCTV (which only records), SAHARA provides **real-time intervention**.

👩‍💻 Contributions

Machine Learning (Detection Model):
I, along with Abhay Sharma and Ayushman, worked on the ML model for detecting spitting, vandalism, littering, and other public nuisance behaviors.
Collected and preprocessed datasets for various uncivil actions.
Trained and fine-tuned the model for accurate real-time detection.
Integrated the trained model with the SAHARA system workflow.

Hardware & System Integration:
Kawin and Dev handled the hardware setup and integration, including:
Connecting cameras, ESP32, buzzers, servos, and mist/glitter spray mechanisms.
Ensuring the ML model’s output triggered real-time deterrent actions.
Developing the embedded control system for smooth workflow between detection and response.

Together, our team combined AI detection and IoT-based response to create a fully functional SAHARA prototype.
